*scMODAL: A general deep learning framework for single-cell Multi-Omics Data Alignment with feature Links*

We introduce scMODAL, a deep learning framework tailored for single-cell multi-omics data alignment using feature links. scMODAL integrates datasets with limited known positively correlated features, leveraging neural networks and generative adversarial networks to align cell embeddings and preserve feature topology. Our experiments demonstrate scMODAL's effectiveness in removing unwanted variation, preserving biological information, and accurately identifying cell subpopulations across diverse datasets. scMODAL not only advances integration tasks but also supports downstream analyses such as feature imputation and inference of feature relationships, offering a robust solution for advancing single-cell multi-omics research.
